# Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK

Welcome to the Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK! You can use JS SDK to implement Reclaim in your browser or Node.js applications. This SDK helps you create a simple process where users can prove their credentials from other websites, all without sharing sensitive information.

## Quick Start for Beginners

New to Reclaim? Here's how to get started:

1. [Installation](./js/installation)
   Get the SDK set up in your project.

2. [Frontend Example (React)](./js/frontend-example)
   Understand the basic flow on how to use the JS SDK.

## How It Works

Here's a simplified flow of how Reclaim works in a typical web application:

1. **User Login**: A user logs into your website.
2. **Session Creation**: Your site creates a new Reclaim session.
3. **Request URL**: Your site generates a request URL. Display this to the user.
4. **User Interaction**: The user visits the request url and logs into the target website (e.g., Amazon.com).
5. **Proof Generation**: A proof is created on the user's device.
6. **Proof Submission**: The user submits the proof to your application.
7. **Verification**: Your app verifies the proof and takes appropriate action.

## Choosing Your Implementation

- **Frontend-only**: Perfect for quick prototypes and MVPs. Implement Reclaim directly in your app without backend changes.
- **Full Stack Implementation**: For production apps, we recommend using the backend implementation along with client application for enhanced security and custom authentication.
