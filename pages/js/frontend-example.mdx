# Frontend Example: Integrating Reclaim SDK in a React Application

This guide will walk you through the fundamental steps to integrate Reclaim's proof verification system into your React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Installed the SDK (see [Installation Guide](./installation))
- Your Application ID, Secret, and Provider ID from the [Reclaim Developer Portal](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/)

<Callout type="warning">Keep your Application Secret secure and never expose it in client-side code.</Callout>

## Implementation

Here's a simple React component that implements Reclaim verification with QR code support:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import QRCode from 'react-qr-code';
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';

function ReclaimDemo() {
  // State to store the verification request URL
  const [requestUrl, setRequestUrl] = useState('');
  const [proofs, setProofs] = useState([]);

  const getVerificationReq = async () => {
    // Your credentials from the Reclaim Developer Portal
    // Replace these with your actual credentials
    const APP_ID = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID';
    const APP_SECRET = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET';
    const PROVIDER_ID = 'YOUR_PROVIDER_ID';

    // Initialize the Reclaim SDK with your credentials
    const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(APP_ID, APP_SECRET, PROVIDER_ID);

    // Generate the verification request URL
    const requestUrl = await reclaimProofRequest.getRequestUrl();
    console.log('Request URL:', requestUrl);
    setRequestUrl(requestUrl);

    // Start listening for proof submissions
    await reclaimProofRequest.startSession({
      // Called when the user successfully completes the verification
      onSuccess: (proofs) => {
        if (proofs) {
          if (typeof proofs === 'string') {
            // When using a custom callback url, the proof is returned to the callback url and we get a message instead of a proof
            console.log('SDK Message:', proofs);
            setProofs([proofs]);
          } else if (typeof proofs !== 'string') {
            // When using the default callback url, we get a proof object in the response
            console.log('Verification success', proofs?.claimData.context);
            setProofs(proofs);
          }
        }
        // Add your success logic here, such as:
        // - Updating UI to show verification success
        // - Storing verification status
        // - Redirecting to another page
      },
      // Called if there's an error during verification
      onError: (error) => {
        console.error('Verification failed', error);

        // Add your error handling logic here, such as:
        // - Showing error message to user
        // - Resetting verification state
        // - Offering retry options
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={getVerificationReq}>Get Verification Request</button>
      {/* Display QR code when URL is available */}
      {requestUrl && (
        <div style={{ margin: '20px 0' }}>
          <QRCode value={requestUrl} />
        </div>
      )}
      {proofs && (
        <div>
          <h2>Verification Successful!</h2>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(proofs, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
}

export default ReclaimDemo;
```

### How it Works

1. **Component Setup**: The component uses a single state variable `requestUrl` to store the verification URL.

2. **Verification Flow**:

   - When the button is clicked, `getVerificationReq` initializes the Reclaim SDK with your credentials
   - It generates a request URL and displays it both as text and as a QR code
   - The component starts listening for proof submissions via `startSession`
   - Success and error callbacks handle the verification result

3. **Display**: The component shows:
   - A button to start verification
   - A QR code (when URL is available)
   - The request URL in text form

## Complete Example Code

For a complete working example of Reclaim Protocol integration in Next.js, check out our [demo repository](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/demo-js-sdk).

<Callout type="info">
  For better user experience, consider conditionally rendering the QR code based on the user's device. On desktop,
  showing a QR code allows users to easily scan with their mobile devices. On mobile devices, displaying the direct link
  is more useful since users can't scan QR codes from the same device.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  🚨 Security Note 🚨 Never expose your APP_SECRET in frontend code. For production: 1. Keep credentials on your backend
  2. Generate the request configuration server-side 3. Use `fromJsonString()` on the frontend See the [Fullstack
  Example](./fullstack-example) for secure implementation.
</Callout>

## Usage and Next Steps

To use this component in your React application:

1. Import it into your main App or desired parent component.
2. Render it within your application's JSX.

<Callout type="info">
  This example provides a basic implementation. In a production environment, you'd want to add more robust error
  handling, loading states, and potentially move the SDK initialization to a more appropriate place in your application
  architecture.
</Callout>

Now that you've learned the basics, you can:

1. Learn about [Advanced Configuration](../advance-configurations/advance-options) options to customize the SDK for your specific needs.
2. Review [Best Practices](./best-practices) for optimizing your Reclaim integration.
