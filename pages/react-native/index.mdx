# Reclaim Protocol React Native SDK

Welcome to the Reclaim Protocol React Native SDK! You can use this SDK to implement Reclaim in your React Native applications. This SDK helps you create a simple process where users can prove their credentials from other websites, all without sharing sensitive information.

## Quick Start for Beginners

New to Reclaim? Here's how to get started:

1. [Installation](./react-native/installation)
   Get the SDK set up in your React Native project.

2. [Basic Example](./react-native/basic-example)
   Understand the basic flow on how to use the React Native SDK.

## How It Works

Here's a simplified flow of how Reclaim works in a typical React Native application:

1. **User Login**: A user logs into your app.
2. **Session Creation**: Your app creates a new Reclaim session.
3. **Request URL**: Your app generates a request URL. Display this to the user.
4. **User Interaction**: The user visits the request URL and logs into the target website (e.g., Amazon.com).
5. **Proof Generation**: A proof is created on the user's device.
6. **Proof Submission**: The user submits the proof to your application.
7. **Verification**: Your app verifies the proof and takes appropriate action.

## Choosing Your Implementation

- **Frontend-only**: Perfect for quick prototypes and MVPs. Implement Reclaim directly in your React Native app without backend changes.
- **Full Stack Implementation**: For production apps, we recommend using a backend implementation along with your React Native app for enhanced security and custom authentication.
