# Installing the Reclaim Protocol React Native SDK

Welcome to the first step in integrating Reclaim Protocol into your React Native project! This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your system
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn as your package manager
- A React Native project set up (if you haven't created one yet, follow the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the SDK

Open your terminal and navigate to your React Native project directory. Then run one of the following commands:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

This command will download and install the Reclaim Protocol SDK and its dependencies into your project.

### 2. Verify Installation

To ensure the SDK was installed correctly, you can check your `package.json` file. You should see `@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk` listed in the `dependencies` section.

## Importing the SDK

After installation, you can import the SDK in your JavaScript or TypeScript files. Here's how:

```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk';
```

For CommonJS environments, you can use:

```javascript
const { ReclaimProofRequest } = require('@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk');
```
