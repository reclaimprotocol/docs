# Publish on-chain with Reclaim contract on Aleph Zero

## Pre-requisite

At this stage, we assume that you are familiar with the steps at [ReactJs](/react).

We will be using [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) as a wallet to interact with the frontend interface. Make sure that you have one of them installed and funded.

You can access the code of this walkthrough on Gitlab:

- [Ink! contract](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-client).
- [Frontend](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-example).

## Contract Deployment

If you don't need to add more checks and logic to on-chain contract, You can skip those steps and use [our already deployed contract on the testnet](https://ui.use.ink/contract/5FB2yCSyjJbKjMJXP8dgZ1kWa7Rin2x9afxzUbmRAaWEj43P).

<Steps>
### Clone the Reclaim Aleph Contract repo.

This [Ink! contract](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-client) serves as a client to our Reclaim protocol. It instantiates Reclaim's contract, handles proofs, and verifies them.

- You can add more checks and logic to your on-chain contract.
- Build Command will bundle your contract into a `.contract` file.

```bash copy
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-client
cd reclaim-aleph-client
cargo contract build --release
```

### Deploy.

Deploy the contract with your account and the `<contract_name>.contract` file through [Contract UI](https://ui.use.ink/).

### Add Epoch

Send transaction to add epoch from the owner account through [Contract UI](https://ui.use.ink/).

- Please use the following args:
  - `minimum_witness_for_claim_creation` - 1
  - `witnesses` - `[{"address": "0x244897572368eadf65bfbc5aec98d8e5443a9072", "host": "reclaim.testnet"}]`

</Steps>

## Frontend Development

<Steps>

### Cloning the frontend repo.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-example

cd reclaim-aleph-example

npm install
```

### Code discovery(GenerateProofPage.tsx).

We will save the proof in the state once we get the `onSuccessCallback`. Fill in your Reclaim credentials marked with `//TODO`s.

- After saving the proof, you can navigate to `VerifyProof` page to verify it.

### Code discovery (src/metadata).

If you deployed your own version of the contract, you will need to update the `addresses.json` file with your contract's account address.
Also, Update `reclaim.json` with your deployed contract json ABI.

### Code discovery (src/utils/verifyProof.ts).

If you deployed your own version of the contract and added more args to the `verify_proof` function or you need to call a different function,
you will need to update this file with your modification.

### Submitting the proof.

```bash
npm start
```

- First, You will need to connect your wallet.
- Then, After requesting a proof from Reclaim and performing the verification on your end, you would need to navigate to `Verify Proof` Page
  Where verify proof button will appear on the screen and be enabled.
- Finally, Clicking on the `Verify Proof` button will send transaction.
