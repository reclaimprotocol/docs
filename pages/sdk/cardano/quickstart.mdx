# Publish on-chain with Reclaim contract on Cardano

## Pre-requisite

- Before proceeding, ensure familiarity with ReactJs development as described
  [here](/js/frontend-example).

- You can access the code of this walkthrough on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/pluts-sdk).

## Dapp Development

<Steps>

### Cloning the `Dapp` repo.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/pluts-sdk

cd pluts-sdk

npm install
```

### Code Discovery (`unlockTx.ts`)

- Primary Functionality: Handles the unlocking of assets on the blockchain.
- Key Functions:
  - getUnlockTx : Assembles the transaction required to unlock assets.
  - unlockTx : Signs and submits the unlock transaction to the blockchain.

### Code Discovery (`lockTx.ts`)

- Primary Functionality: Manages the locking of assets into the blockchain.
- Key Functions:
  - getLockTx : Prepares the transaction for locking assets.
  - lockTx : Signs and submits the lock transaction to the blockchain.

### Code Discovery (`reclaimPlutus.ts`)

- Description: Contains smart contract logic used in transaction validation.
- Components:
  - Datum and Redeemer : Structures that define the data formats for smart contracts.
  - scriptTestnetAddr : Specifies the blockchain address for script execution.

### Verification Flow

#### Connect Wallet

- use Nami wallet to connect to the testnet.

#### Generate Proof

- Scan Qrcode to start `Reclaim App` and generate a proof.

#### Lock Proof

- After generating the proof, you will need to lock your proof on-chain so only you can unlock it.

#### Verify by unlocking

- Verify that you own data by unlocking the published proof on-chain.

</Steps>

### Contract Deployment

- Contract is deployed on the testnet. you can find the contract address [here](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/address/addr_test1wzv5v4jx3xaz4nlgp6j6juw707huauprhfdkst66mlh0fcsgk7uvw).
