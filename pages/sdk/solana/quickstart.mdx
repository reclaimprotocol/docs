# Quickstart for Solana

## Pre-requisite

This tutorial assumes that you have a frontend that requests proofs from the user and processes the response, like [React](/js/frontend), [React Native](/react-native), or [Node](/js/backend).

## Solana

<Steps>

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure that your development environment meets the following prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust** - The programming language used for writing Solana programs. Install Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) .

2. **Solana Tool Suite** - Provides the Solana CLI and other tools necessary for interacting with the Solana network. Install the Solana Tool Suite by following the instructions [here]() .

3. **Node.js** - Required for running JavaScript and TypeScript scripts. Download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) .

4. **Yarn Package Manager** - A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool.
   Install Yarn globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

5. **Anchor Framework** - A framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime providing several developer tools. Install Anchor by following the instructions [here](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation) .

### Repository Structure

Understanding the repository structure will help you navigate and modify the code as needed.

- **`programs/reclaim`** - The Anchor smart contract code for the Reclaim program.

- **`sdk`** - The auto-generated SDK folder using Solita.

- **`scripts`** - Automated scripts to streamline certain initialization processes.

- **`program-keypairs`** - The keypairs stored for vanity addresses.

- **`tests`** - The test suites that are run during `anchor test`.

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-solana-sdk.git
cd reclaim-solana-sdk
yarn install
```

This command installs all necessary dependencies for both the SDK and the scripts.

### Setup

The setup process involves generating a new program keypair and updating the configuration files to use the newly generated program ID. This ensures that you have a unique program ID for your deployment.

Run the setup script:

```bash
yarn setup
```

The setup script performs the following actions:

- **Generates a new program keypair** : Creates a new Solana keypair for the program and saves it to `program-keypairs/reclaim-program-keypair.json`.

- **Updates configuration files** : Replaces the program ID in `Anchor.toml`, `.solitarc.js`, `lib.rs`, and other utility files with the new program ID.

- **Prepares the project for deployment** : Ensures that all references to the program ID are consistent across the project.

### Building the SDK

Before deploying the contract, you need to build the SDK. The SDK contains TypeScript definitions and client code generated from the Solana program.

Build the SDK using the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command compiles the SDK and generates the required build artifacts, making it ready for interaction with the Solana program.

## Deploying the Contract

Deploying the Reclaim smart contract involves building the Anchor project and deploying it to the Solana network of your choice.

### Building the Anchor Project

First, build the Anchor project to compile the smart contract code:

```bash
anchor build
```

This command compiles the Rust code located in the `programs/reclaim` directory, producing a deployable Solana program.

### Deploying to Solana Network

Deploy the contract using the generated program keypair:

```bash
anchor deploy --program-name reclaim --program-keypair program-keypairs/reclaim-program-keypair.json
```

- **`--program-name reclaim`** : Specifies the name of the program as defined in `Anchor.toml`.

- **`--program-keypair`** : Points to the keypair file generated during the setup.
  **Note** : The default network for deployment is `devnet`. To deploy to a different network, see [Specifying the Network](/solana/quickstart#specifying-the-network) .After deployment, take note of the **Program ID** displayed in the output:

```yaml
Program Id: YourProgramIDHere
```

Ensure that this Program ID matches the one generated during the setup.

## Configuring the Program

After deploying the program, you need to initialize the `epochConfig` account, which is essential for the Reclaim protocol's operation.

### Backfilling Epochs

Run the backfill command to initialize the `epochConfig` account:

```bash
yarn backfill
```

This command:

- Derives the Program Derived Address (PDA) for the `epochConfig` account.

- Initializes the `epochConfig` account on the Solana network.

- Configures the initial epoch settings.
  Take note of the **Epoch config address** displayed in the output:

```arduino
Epoch config address: YourEpochConfigAddressHere
```

This address is required for adding new epochs and interacting with the program.

### Adding an Epoch

To add an epoch, use the `add-epoch` command, passing the `epochConfig` address as an argument:

```bash
yarn add-epoch <EpochConfigAddress>
```

Replace `<EpochConfigAddress>` with the actual address from the backfill step.
This command:

- Reads the current `epochIndex` from the `epochConfig` account.

- Derives the PDA for the new epoch.

- Creates and initializes the new epoch account on the Solana network.

## Specifying the Network

By default, the SDK interacts with the Solana `devnet` network. You can change the network by setting the `SOLANA_CLUSTER` environment variable. The supported networks are:

- **devnet** (default)

- **testnet**

- **mainnet-beta**

### Using Scripts on Different Networks

To run scripts on a different network, set the `SOLANA_CLUSTER` variable before the command:**Example: Backfilling epochs on testnet**

```bash
SOLANA_CLUSTER=testnet yarn backfill
```

**Example: Adding an epoch on mainnet-beta**

```bash
SOLANA_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta yarn add-epoch <EpochConfigAddress>
```

### Deploying on Different Networks

To deploy the contract on networks other than devnet, you need to adjust the `Anchor.toml` configuration and specify the network during deployment.

**Step 1**: Update `Anchor.toml`, replace the `[programs.devnet]` section with the network you want to deploy to:

For **testnet** :

```toml
[programs.testnet]
reclaim = "YourProgramIDHere"

[provider]
cluster = "testnet"
```

For **mainnet-beta** :

```toml
[programs.mainnet]
reclaim = "YourProgramIDHere"

[provider]
cluster = "mainnet"
```

**Step 2: Deploy the Program** Use the `--provider.cluster` option with `anchor deploy`:

```bash
anchor deploy --provider.cluster testnet --program-name reclaim --program-keypair program-keypairs/reclaim-program-keypair.json
```

Replace `testnet` with `mainnet` for mainnet-beta.

**Note** : Ensure that you have sufficient funds in your wallet on the target network to cover deployment costs.

</Steps>

By following this documentation, you should be able to set up your environment, deploy the Reclaim smart contract, and interact with it on the Solana blockchain.
