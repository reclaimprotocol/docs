# Publish on chain using js-stellar-sdk

## Pre-requisite

You can access the code on Gitlab:

- [Soroban contract](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/stellar-sdk).
- [Frontend example](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-stellar-example).

These two repos hold all configurations and metadata required to publish a Reclaim proof to Stellar.

You will need the [Soroban CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup) to build the smart contract. Also, we are using [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) wallet for this walkthrough, make sure to have it installed. Once Freighter is installed and configured, go on and allow experimental features by switching it in `Settings > Preferences`, this is required to try the frontend in localhost.  

## Contract and JS interactions

You can skip this part if you wish to verify on our [deployed contract](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CA4OZVT36RMBNI5MRDB4724N5LJ4H2FDA633UO2SH37DPLFRBXVBPNVT) with address `CA4OZVT36RMBNI5MRDB4724N5LJ4H2FDA633UO2SH37DPLFRBXVBPNVT`.
<Steps>
### Clone the client contract repo.

```bash copy
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/stellar-sdk.git
cd stellar-sdk
soroban contract build
```

### Deploy the contract.

Upload to Stellar network and instantiate the contract.

```bash copy
soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/reclaim.wasm --source reclaim --network testnet
export CONTRACT= // Paste in the resulting contract address
export ACCOUNT= // Paste in your public address 
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT --source reclaim --network testnet -- instantiate --user $ACCOUNT
```

Save the contract address, it is the only contract-specific metadata to be used in the frontend client.


</Steps>


## React client development
<Steps>

### Cloning the frontend repo.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-stellar-example.git

cd reclaim-stellar-example

npm install
```

### Code discovery.
In your `App.js`, make sure you have your Reclaim credentials ready for placeholders marked with ```//TODO```s. For your convenience, we included some smoke credentials for Steam Id provider.

Add your contract address to `.env`. If you wish to use our contract, just copy contents of `.env.example` to your `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Submitting the proof.

```bash
npm run build

npm run start
```
After requesting a proof from Reclaim and performing the verification on your end, a verify proof button will appear on the screen.
Make sure your wallet is connected, click the button, a wallet pop-up will show prompting you to submit.
