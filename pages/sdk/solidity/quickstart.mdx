# Quickstart for Solidity

## Pre-requisite

This tutorial assumes that you have a frontend that requests proofs from the user and processes the response, like [React](/js/frontend-example), [React Native](/react-native), or [Node](/js/backend-example).

## Supported Networks

Before diving into the Solidity integration, ensure you are aware of the supported networks where Reclaim contracts are already deployed. The Reclaim Solidity SDK supports a variety of EVM-compatible chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, and more.

For a full list of supported networks and their contract addresses, check out the [supported networks here](./supported-networks).

## Solidity

This section walks you through deploying and integrating a Reclaim contract into your Solidity project.

<Steps>

### Deploy a smart contract

Deploy the following contract to any EVM-compatible network of your choice. In this walkthrough, we'll be using Ethereum as an example.

```solidity copy showLineNumbers
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk/contracts/Reclaim.sol";
import "@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk/contracts/Addresses.sol";

contract Attestor {
   address public reclaimAddress;

   constructor() {
      // Replace with the network you are deploying on
      reclaimAddress = Addresses.ETHEREUM;
   }

   function verifyProof(Reclaim.Proof memory proof) public view {
       Reclaim(reclaimAddress).verifyProof(proof);
       // Your business logic upon successful verification
       // Example: Verify that proof.context matches your expectations
   }
}
```

You can check out the supported networks by the `@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk` package in [here](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/verifier-solidity-sdk/-/blob/main/contracts/Addresses.sol)

### Context Field

Each proof contains a `context` field inside the `proof.claimInfo` structure. This field allows you to embed additional data, such as a message and an address, which can be useful for verifying specific context details like user identity or specific claims (e.g., SteamId if you're using the SteamId provider).

Since `context` is a `string`, you may want to extract specific fields from it. To simplify this, the Reclaim SDK provides the following utility function:

```solidity copy
function extractFieldFromContext(string memory data, string memory target)
public pure returns (string memory)
```

- `data`: The `context` string from the proof.
- `target`: The name of the field you wish to extract.

#### Example

To extract the `SteamId` from the context, pass the target in this format:

```
'"SteamId":"'
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure the `target` string is formatted exactly as shown, including the double
  quotes and colon. format: '"FIELD_NAME_HERE":"' (e.g. '"SteamId":"')
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  You can use the same function to extract other context fields such as
  `contextAddress` or `contextMessage` using the same approach.
</Callout>

### Obtain Artifacts

After deploying the contract, make sure to take note of the following essential details:

- **Chain ID**: For example, ETHEREUM has a chain ID of `1`.
- **Contract Address**: The address of your deployed contract.
- **ABI**: The contract's Application Binary Interface, which you will need for interacting with the contract.

### Publish on chain

You can publish your contract and interact with it using popular libraries like:

- [wagmi.js](./wagmi) – A set of React hooks for Ethereum development.
- [ethers.js]() – A comprehensive library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
