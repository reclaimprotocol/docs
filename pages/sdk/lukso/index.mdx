## Overview

The Reclaim Protocol Proofs are compatible with blockchain applications.

## Flow

1. Your app requests proofs from the user using one of the front-end libraries like [Reclaim React SDK](/js/frontend-example), [Reclaim React Native SDK](/react-native), [Reclaim Flutter SDK](/flutter) or a backend library like [Reclaim Node SDK](/js/backend-example)
2. Once the user has uploaded the proof, you can keep a note of it for on-chain verification
3. Submit the serialized proof to your smart contract
4. Verify the proof on the smart contract
