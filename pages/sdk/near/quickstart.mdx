# Publish on-chain with Reclaim contract on Near

## Pre-requisite

At this stage, we assume that you are familiar with the steps at [ReactJs](/js/frontend-example).

We will be using [HereWallet](https://www.herewallet.app/) and [MyNearWallet](https://www.mynearwallet.com/) as a wallet to interact with the frontend interface. Make sure that you have one of them installed and funded.

Also, you will need to have the [Near CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli-rs) installed.

You can access the code of this walkthrough on Gitlab:

- [Near contract](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/near-sdk).
- [Frontend](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-near-example).

## Contract Deployment

If you don't need to add more checks and logic to on-chain contract, You can skip those steps and use our already deployed contract on the testnet or mainnet:

- Mainnet: [reclaim-protocol-mainnet.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/reclaim-protocol-mainnet.near?tab=txns)
- Testnet: [reclaim-protocol.testnet](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/reclaim-protocol.testnet)

<Steps>
### Clone the near contract sdk repo.

This [Near contract](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/near-sdk) serves as a client to our Reclaim protocol. It instantiates Reclaim's contract, handles proofs, and verifies them.

```bash copy
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/near-sdk
cd near-sdk
cargo near build
```

### Create new account or import an existing account.

Use `near-cli` to create a new account or import an existing account.

```bash copy
near account import-account using-web-wallet network-config testnet
```

### Deploy.

Deploy the contract with your account and the wasm file.

```bash copy
  near contract deploy <ACCOUNT_ID\> use-file <PATH_TO_WASM_BUILD> with-init-call init text-args '' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### Add Epoch

Send transaction to add epoch from the owner account.

```bash copy
near contract call-function as-transaction <ACCOUNT_ID\> add_epoch \
  json-args '{"minimum_witness_for_claim_creation": 1, "epoch_start": 1717429000, "epoch_end": 1817429000, "witnesses": [{"address": "244897572368eadf65bfbc5aec98d8e5443a9072", "host": "reclaim.testnet"}]}' \
  prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <ACCOUNT_ID\> \
  network-config testnet sign-with-keychain

```

</Steps>

## Frontend Development

<Steps>

### Features

- **Proof Submission**: Generate proof requests and submit them on-chain.
- **Proof Verification**: Verify submitted proofs directly through the smart contract.
- **Wallet Connection**: Built-in wallet connection.

### Cloning the frontend repo.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-near-example

cd reclaim-near-frontend-example
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Code discovery (src/components/create-new-proof.js).

We will submit the proof on chain once we get the `onSuccessCallback`. Fill in your Reclaim credentials marked with `//TODO`s.

```js copy showLineNumbers {33-38}
import { Reclaim } from "@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk";
import { useState } from "react";
import { useQRCode } from "next-qrcode";

export const CreateNewProof = ({ setNewProof, setReadyToVerify }) => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState("");
  const { Canvas } = useQRCode();

  const reclaimClient = new Reclaim.ProofRequest(""); //TODO: replace with your applicationId

  async function generateVerificationRequest() {
    const providerId = ""; //TODO: replace with your provider ids you had selected while creating the application

    reclaimClient.addContext(
      `user's address`,
      "for acmecorp.com on 1st january"
    );

    await reclaimClient.buildProofRequest(providerId);

    reclaimClient.setSignature(
      await reclaimClient.generateSignature(
        "" //TODO : replace with your APP_SECRET
      )
    );

    const { requestUrl, statusUrl } =
      await reclaimClient.createVerificationRequest();

    setUrl(requestUrl);

    await reclaimClient.startSession({
      onSuccessCallback: (proofs) => {
        console.log("Verification success", proofs);
        setNewProof(proofs[0]);
        setReadyToVerify(true);
        // Your business logic here
      },
      onFailureCallback: (error) => {
        console.error("Verification failed", error);
        // Your business logic here to handle the error
      },
    });
  }
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        alignItems: "center",
        justifyContent: "center",
        height: "50vh",
      }}
    >
      {!url && (
        <button
          className="btn btn-secondary"
          onClick={generateVerificationRequest}
        >
          Create New Proof
        </button>
      )}
      {url && (
        <Canvas
          text={url}
          options={{
            errorCorrectionLevel: "M",
            margin: 3,
            scale: 4,
            width: 200,
            color: {
              dark: "#010599FF",
              light: "#FFBF60FF",
            },
          }}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Code discovery (src/config.js).

If you deployed your own version of the contract, you will need to update the `contractPerNetwork`
list with your contract's account address.

```js copy showLineNumbers {2, 3}
const contractPerNetwork = {
  mainnet: "reclaim-protocol-mainnet.near", // Replace it with your contract's account address
  testnet: "reclaim-protocol.testnet", // Replace it with your contract's account address
};

export const NetworkId = "testnet";
export const ReclaimNearContract = contractPerNetwork[NetworkId];

export const SMOKE_PROOF = {
  identifier:
    "0x9ec8f9f52623234433ce5ea0cc0f5aac0dfbeef553e68d2d403633bd9192e365",
  claimData: {
    provider: "http",
    parameters:
      '{"body":"","geoLocation":"in","method":"GET","paramValues":{"CLAIM_DATA":"76561199614512180"},"responseMatches":[{"type":"contains","value":"_steamid\\">Steam ID: {{CLAIM_DATA}}</div>"}],"responseRedactions":[{"jsonPath":"","regex":"_steamid\\">Steam ID: (.*)</div>","xPath":"id(\\"responsive_page_template_content\\")/div[@class=\\"page_header_ctn\\"]/div[@class=\\"page_content\\"]/div[@class=\\"youraccount_steamid\\"]"}],"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/account/"}',
    owner: "0xa1b6e6ffb85df5bdf78e6558d3224ab87f7cc4c7",
    timestampS: 1717053708,
    context:
      '{"contextAddress":"user\'s address","contextMessage":"for acmecorp.com on 1st january","extractedParameters":{"CLAIM_DATA":"76561199614512180"},"providerHash":"0x5f5312e27124dc7605f70a7d884e169049679b93f91c137b4d18a8569d825900"}',
    identifier:
      "0x9ec8f9f52623234433ce5ea0cc0f5aac0dfbeef553e68d2d403633bd9192e365",
    epoch: 1,
  },
  signatures: [
    "0xcbad077154cc5c8e494576d4336f57972f7412058c1a637e05832c6bdabd018f4da18ad973f29553921d7d030370032addac1159146b77ec6cc5dab4133ffec01c",
  ],
  witnesses: [
    {
      id: "0x244897572368eadf65bfbc5aec98d8e5443a9072",
      url: "https://reclaim-node.questbook.app",
    },
  ],
};
```

### Submitting the proof.

```bash
npm run dev
```

- First, You will need to connect your near account.
- Then, After requesting a proof from Reclaim and performing the verification on your end, a verify proof button will appear on the screen.
- Finally, Clicking on the `Verify Proof` button will send transaction.

![screen2](/near-fe-1.jpg)

![near-exp](/near-exp.png)

Now your proof will get approved on-chain, here is the sample [transaction](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/Cwi8sSMwQzDqT818d6UFAxZjrEnMB8TNKs5RtEXDaMm4) from the screenshot above.

### Code Overview

`src/components/create-new-proof.js`

- Proof Request: Configures and initiates proof requests through Reclaimâ€™s SDK.
- QR Code Generation: Displays a QR code for users to scan and submit proofs.
- Proof Submission: Handles on-chain submission upon proof verification.

`src/pages/index.js`

- Proof Transformation: Transforms the received proof to be compatible with the smart contract.
- Verification Process: Sends a transaction to verify the proof on-chain and provides a link to the transaction on the explorer.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Wallet Connection Issues**: Ensure that your wallet is set to the correct network that you contract is deployed on and refresh the page if the connection fails.
- **Proof Submission Fails**: Double-check your Reclaim credentials, contract address, and that the correct network is selected.
