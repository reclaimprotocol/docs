# Publish on chain using gear-js

## Pre-requisite

You can access the code of this walkthrough on Gitlab:

- [Gear contract](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/gear-sdk).
- [Frontend example](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-gear-example).

These two repos hold all configurations and metadata required to publish a Reclaim proof to Vara network.

## Contract and JS interactions

<Steps>
### Clone the client contract repo.

```bash copy
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/gear-sdk
cd reclaim-gear
cargo b --workspace
```

### Add your wallet information.

As stated in the README, add your wallet credentials to your `js/.env` as specified in `js/.env.example`.

```bash copy
MNEMONIC= // Your mnemonic
```

### Deploy contract.

Follow steps at [Gear Wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/getting-started-in-5-minutes) to set up a wallet, generate artifiacts, and deploy through [IDEA](idea.gear-tech.io).
Upon deployment, add your contract address to your `js/.env`.

```bash copy
ADDRESS= // Your contract address
```

### Verify a proof.

Give the `js/index.js` file a quick read, make sure that you have the correct RPCs and contract addresses.

There are three functions of interest here:

- `initiate`: Pings the contract to bootstrap an initial state.

- `addEpoch`: Adds witnesses for epochs.

- `verifyProof`: Verifies a proof.

Run the script with `npm run start`. You may comment and un-comment depending on your purpose, but note that functions should be called in the order stated above.

</Steps>

Here is a sample proof verification [transaction](https://idea.gear-tech.io/messages/0x0635ac7face036c37297e74a6a86c4a3be18019b60fcdfccf1af84b0ca10c771?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network).

## React client development

<Steps>

### Features

- **Proof Submission**: Generate proof requests and submit them on-chain.
- **Proof Verification**: Verify submitted proofs directly through the smart contract.
- **Wallet Connection**: Built-in wallet connection.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Run this command:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-gear-example.git
cd reclaim-gear-example
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Code Configuration

In `src/App.tsx`, fill in the necessary Reclaim credentials and replace `TODO` comments with your application-specific data:

```javascript
const APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID"; // Replace with your application ID
const providerId = "YOUR_PROVIDER_ID"; // Replace with your provider ID
const APP_SECRET = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"; // Replace with your app secret
```

In `src/config/constants.js` you can find the necessary configuration to connect the wallet and interact with the smart contract. You can change depending on what network you're using:

```javascript
export const GEAR_NODE = "replace-this-with-gear-node-on-the-wanted-network";
```

### 4. Update Contract Address

If you deployed a custom contract, update the contract address and the metadata in `src/config/constants.js` :

```javascript
export const CONTRACT = "replace-with-your-contract-address";
export const METADATA = "replace-with-your-metadata";
```

---

## Usage

After configuration, you can run the project locally to test the proof verification process.

### Start the Application

Run this command:

```bash
npm run start
```

1. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure your wallet is connected and set to the correct network.
2. **Request Proof**: Click the "Create Claim QR Code" button to generate a QR code for proof submission.
3. **Verify Proof**: Once the proof is received, a "Verify Proof" button appears. Click it to submit a transaction for on-chain verification.
4. **View Transaction**: After verification, a link to view the transaction on the explorer will be available.

---

## Code Overview

`src/App.js`

- Proof Request: Configures and initiates proof requests through Reclaimâ€™s SDK.
- QR Code Generation: Displays a QR code for users to scan and submit proofs.
- Proof Submission: Handles on-chain submission upon proof verification.

`src/verify-proof.jsx`

- Proof Transformation: Transforms the received proof to be compatible with the smart contract.
- Verification Process: Sends a transaction to verify the proof on-chain and provides a link to the transaction on the explorer.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Wallet Connection Issues**: Ensure that your wallet is set to the correct network that you contract is deployed on and refresh the page if the connection fails.
- **Proof Submission Fails**: Double-check your Reclaim credentials, contract address, and that the correct network is selected.
