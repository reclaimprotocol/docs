## Integration

Following is an example on how we used the [Github Username Provider](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/provider/6d3f6753-7ee6-49ee-a545-62f1b1822ae5) with the InApp SDK in an ios native application to verify Github account ownership.

This is how Reclaim's verification flow can be fully integrated within your native mobile application.

## Installation

The InApp SDKs are available on all major mobile platforms. For each platform, you can find the installation instructions in the following pages:

* [Android](./installation/android)
* [iOS](./installation/ios)
* [React Native](./installation/react-native)
* [React Native Expo](./installation/react-native-expo)
* [Flutter](./installation/flutter)
* [Ionic - Capacitor](./installation/ionic-capacitor)

You can request an addition of new platform/framework, contact us for more info.

## Verification

Proofs generated on the client must be verified at the backend. Follow the instructions from [the Backend Verification Guide](./verification).

## Advanced Usage

You can customize the verification flow with options, and, as an advanced use—set up overrides or use authentication with the attestor. Learn more from [the Usage documentation](./advanced/intro).
