## Usage

To use ReclaimInAppSdk in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the ReclaimInAppSdk module into your Kotlin/Java file.

```kotlin
import org.reclaimprotocol.inapp_sdk.ReclaimVerification
```

2. Create a request object.

```kotlin
val request = ReclaimVerification.Request(
        appId = "YOUR_APP_ID",
        secret = "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
        providerId = "YOUR_PROVIDER_ID"
    )
```

Or if you have added the APP_ID and APP_SECRET metadata to your AndroidManifest.xml file, you can create the request object using the `ReclaimVerification.Request.fromManifestMetaData` method.

```kotlin
    val request = ReclaimVerification.Request.fromManifestMetaData(
        context = context,
        providerId = "YOUR_PROVIDER_ID"
    )
```

3. Start the verification flow.


```kotlin
ReclaimVerification.startVerification(
    context = context,
    request = request,
    handler = object : ReclaimVerification.ResultHandler {
        override fun onException(exception: ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException) {
            Log.e("MainActivity", "Something went wrong", exception)
            val reason = when (exception) {
                is ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException.Failed -> "Failed because: ${exception.reason}"
                is ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException.Cancelled -> "Verification cancelled"
                is ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException.Dismissed -> "Dismissed by user"
                is ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException.SessionExpired -> "Session expired"
            }
            Log.d("MainActivity", "reason: $reason")
        }

        override fun onResponse(response: ReclaimVerification.Response) {
            Log.d("MainActivity", response.toString())
        }
    }
)
```

The returned result `ReclaimVerification.ResultHandler.onResponse` in is a `ReclaimVerification.Response` object. This object contains a response that has proofs, exception, and the sessionId if the verification is successful.

If the verification is cancelled or failed, the handler's `ReclaimVerification.ResultHandler.onException` method is called with a `ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException` object.
