# Reclaim Protocol: Decentralized Architecture and Incentives

The Reclaim protocol's decentralized architecture relies on smart contracts and a network of Attestor nodes to ensure secure and trustless data verification.

## Core Smart Contracts

* **Task Contract:**
    * Responsible for creating Claim Tasks and achieving Claim consensus.
* **Governance Contract:**
    * Manages Attestor nodes, providing staking, rewards, and penalty mechanisms.

## Attestor Registration & Staking

* Attestors must stake a minimum number tokens in the Governance Contract.
* Rewards are distributed based on the staking ratio.
* Attestors must maintain online availability.

## Decentralized Proof of Possession (PoP)

1.  **Claim Task Request:**
    * The user submits a "create claim task" request to the Task Contract via the Reclaim SDK.

2.  **Attestor Selection:**
    * The Task Contract randomly selects Attestors and returns them to the SDK.

3.  **zkTLS Protocol Execution:**
    * The Reclaim SDK establishes connections with the selected Attestors to execute the zkTLS protocol.

4.  **Proof Submission:**
    * Each Attestor returns a Proof to the SDK, Proofs then are submitted to the Task Contract.

5.  **Proof Consensus:**
    * The Task Contract achieves Proof consensus based on the 51% rule.

6.  **Proof Verification and Storage:**
    * The Task Contract verifies the Proof and stores the result upon successful validation.

## Unstaking

* Upon an unstaking request, the system initiates an undelegation process with a chain-defined unbonding period (e.g., 21 days).
* After the unbonding period, the remaining tokens are calculated and returned to the Attestorâ€™s account, accounting for potential slashing risks.

## Try It

Contracts can be found on [Github](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/attestor-contracts).

### Admin setup

If you wish to try things beforehand, try the following upon cloning and installing packages.

1.  **Populate your `.env`:**
    * `PRIVATE_KEY=0x..`

2.  **Run the deploy script:**
    * `npx hardhat deploy --network $YOUR_NETWORK`

3.  **Create a task request:**
    * `npx hardhat create-task-request --network $YOUR_NETWORK`

### Attestor Example 

The [example](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/attestor-contracts/tree/main/examples/attestor) showcases the complete proof lifecycle. 

1.  **Change directory into /examples/attestor and install packages:**
    * `npm install`

2.  **Populate your `.env`, variables are filled for you, you just need to add you private key (without the `0x` prefix):**
    * `PRIVATE_KEY=`

3.  **Download zk files:**
    * `node node_modules/@reclaimprotocol/zk-symmetric-crypto/lib/scripts/download-files`

4. **Run the script:**
    * `node index.js`

### zkFetch Example - Outdated

Alternatively, you can try out an e2e [example](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/attestor-contracts/tree/main/examples/zkfetch). This example echoes a previous deployment, but we kept it still for demonstration purposes.

1.  **Change directory into /examples/zkfetch and install packages:**
    * `npm install`

2.  **Populate your `.env`, add you private key (without the `0x` prefix):**
    * `PRIVATE_KEY=`

3. **Run the script:**
    * `node index.js`
