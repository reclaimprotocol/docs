title: The Education Bundle
description: Over 20k universities world wide supported
---

Currently in Beta : Please [contact support](mailto:harsha@reclaimprotocol.org) to get started.

## Provider ID is optional
- If you want to ask the user which university they study in, followed by verification of that university - leave the `providerId` blank. The user will be presented with a search functionality to search for their university.
- If you know that the student is from a particular university and you want to verify if the student is enrolled in that specific university, you can pass the provider ID. You can find the provider ID from the [Dev Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).

## UI
If the provider ID is not set, the user will be asked to choose their university

## Callback
To the callback you set, you will receive a json like so : 
```json
{
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "YOUR SESSION ID",
    "applicationId": "YOUR APPLICATION ID",
    "bundleId": "default",
    "proofs": [
      {
        "success": true,
        "data": {
          "fullName": "...", // Mandatory
          "fieldOfStudy": "...", // Optional. What the student is studying
          "dob": "...", // Optional. Date of birth
          "gradYear": "...", // Optional. Expected date of graduation
        },
        "metadata": {
          "verified": true,
          "timestamp": 1766854715373
        }
      }
    ],
    "timestamp": "2025-12-27T16:58:35.373Z"
  },
  "signature": "0x5515a680e6f05d844c1e54aa231b...RECLAIMPROTOCOL_SIGNATURE"
}
```

You can see all the parameter's [descriptions here](../usage). 
The fields in the `data` section will always be the same for all universities. 
If you are using this to verify student enrollment, even if you know the provider ID, we recommend using `bundleId=education` so that we can make sure all the universities responses are consistently formatted. Because, we do see some community providers to have slightly different schema or parameters making it messy to manage all edgecases.
