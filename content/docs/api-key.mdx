title: Get an API key
description: For all the SDKs mentioned on this docs page, you need an `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET` and a `PROVIDER_ID`
---

## 0. Register
First, head to the [Reclaim Protocol Dev Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org). 
Create an account here if you haven't already.

## 1. Create an Application
Head to [My Applicatons](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/my-applications) from the left navigation bar. Here, tap on [New Application](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/application-creation).


### Copy your Application ID and secret
Once you create the application, you will be shown the Application ID and Application Secret. 
Be sure to copy them into your `.env` file immediately. 

<Callout type="warning">
    You will not be able to see the Application Secret once you leave this screen.
</Callout>

## 2. Add providers
Once you have created the application, you will have to add providers that are supported by this application. You will NOT be able to generate proofs for providers that are not already added to your application.

You will be prompted to add providers when creating the application. You can always go back to your application and add more providers.

After adding the providers, you should copy the `provider ID` and keep them handy.

## 3. Integrate your SDK
Now, you can head over to the integration guide for your platform - where you can paste these values to get the application up and running!
