---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js) or yarn
- A working React Native project
  - If you haven't created one, follow the official [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

> **Note**: Make sure your React Native project is properly configured and can run successfully before installing the SDK.

## Installation

### 1. Install the SDK

Navigate to your React Native project's root directory and execute one of the following commands:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

### 2. Installation Verification

Verify the installation by:

1. Checking your `package.json` file for:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk": "^x.x.x"
   }
   ```
2. Ensuring no error messages appeared during installation

## Implementation

### Importing the SDK

Import the SDK in your JavaScript/TypeScript files using either of these methods:

ES6+ syntax (recommended):
```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk';
```

CommonJS syntax:
```javascript
const { ReclaimProofRequest } = require('@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk');
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed the SDK successfully, you can:

1. Follow the [Basic Example](./basic-example) guide to create your first proof request
2. Explore [Advanced Configuration](../advance-configurations/advance-options) options for customization
3. Review best practices and implementation patterns
