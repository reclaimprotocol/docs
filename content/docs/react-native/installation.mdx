### Prerequisites

1. Setup your project using the [Get API Key guide](/api-key).
2. A provider id that you've added to your app from [Reclaim Devtools](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).

### Setup your app for using Reclaim InApp SDK

Install Reclaim InApp SDKs to your React Native app if you haven't already done so. Choose the appropriate installation guide based on your project setup:

**For React Native projects without Expo:**
📖 [Installation Guide for React Native (No Framework)](/react-native/install/no-framework)

**For React Native Expo projects:**
📖 [Installation Guide for React Native Expo](/react-native/install/expo)

## Example

- See the [Reclaim Example - React Native without Framework](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-inapp-reactnative-sdk/blob/main/samples/example_new_arch/README.md) for a complete example of how to use the SDK in a React Native application.
- See the [Reclaim Example - React Native Expo](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-inapp-reactnative-sdk/blob/main/samples/example_expo/README.md) for a complete example of how to use the SDK in a React Native Expo application.

## Usage

To use Reclaim InApp Sdk in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the `@reclaimprotocol/inapp-rn-sdk` package in your project file.

```js
import { ReclaimVerification } from '@reclaimprotocol/inapp-rn-sdk';
```

2. Initialize the `ReclaimVerification` class to create an instance.

```js
const reclaimVerification = new ReclaimVerification();
```

### Starting Verification

#### Quickly trying verifications with Reclaim

Start the verification flow by simply providing an app id, secret and a provider id.

  - You can use the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` that you received when you setup API key using [this guide](/api-key)
  - The `PROVIDER_ID` is identifier for the proof provider you want your users to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).

```js
const verificationResult = await reclaimVerification.startVerification({
    appId: config.REACT_APP_RECLAIM_APP_ID ?? '',
    secret: config.REACT_APP_RECLAIM_APP_SECRET ?? '',
    providerId: providerId,
});
```

The returned result is a `ReclaimVerification.Response` object. This object contains a response that has proofs, exception, and the sessionId if the verification is successful.

#### Recommended way to start verification

We highly recommend that you create a verification session on your backend server using our [JS SDK](/js-sdk/preparing-request#send-back-the-proof-request-object-to-the-frontend). This way, you can avoid exposing your `APP_SECRET` in your mobile app.

You can export the session generated at your backend using `request.toJsonString()`. Then, you can use this exported session to start the verification in your React Native app.

```js
const verificationResult = await reclaimVerification.startVerificationFromJson(JSON.parse(requestJsonString));
``` 

### Verifying the Result

After the verification is completed, you can verify the proofs from this result on your backend server using our [JS SDK](/js-sdk/verifying-proofs#verify-the-proof).

```js
import { verifyProof } from "@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk";

// Important: This should happen on your backend server
verifyProof(verificationResult.proofs);
```

### Exception Handling

If the verification ends with an exception, the exception is thrown as a [ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException] object.

Following is an example of how to handle the exception using [error.type]:

```js
try {
  // ... start verification
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException) {
    switch (error.type) {
      case ReclaimVerification.ExceptionType.Cancelled:
        Snackbar.show({
          text: 'Verification cancelled',
          duration: Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG,
        });
        break;
      case ReclaimVerification.ExceptionType.Dismissed:
        Snackbar.show({
          text: 'Verification dismissed',
          duration: Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG,
        });
        break;
      case ReclaimVerification.ExceptionType.SessionExpired:
        Snackbar.show({
          text: 'Verification session expired',
          duration: Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG,
        });
        break;
      case ReclaimVerification.ExceptionType.Failed:
      default:
        Snackbar.show({
          text: 'Verification failed',
          duration: Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG,
        });
    }
  } else {
    Snackbar.show({
      text: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'An unknown verification error occurred',
      duration: Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG,
    });
  }
}
```

This error also contains `sessionId`, `reason`, and `innerError` that can be used to get more details about the occurred error.

```js
error.sessionId
error.reason
error.innerError
```

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the verification flow with options, and, as an advanced use—set up overrides or use authentication with the attestor. Learn more from [the Usage documentation](/inapp-sdks/advanced/intro).
