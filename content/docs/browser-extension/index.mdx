description: Seamlessly integrate Reclaim Protocol verification into your Chrome browser extension
---

## Overview

Build browser extensions with Reclaim Protocol verification capabilities. This SDK handles Chrome extension architecture (MV3, service workers, offscreen documents), WebAssembly proof generation, and provider tab management.

### Key Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Manifest V3 Compatible**: Full Chrome MV3 support
- ‚ö° **WebAssembly Proofs**: High-performance cryptographic proof generation
- üîÑ **Event-Driven**: Real-time updates via clean event API
- üì¶ **Pre-built Bundles**: No re-bundling required

## Two Integration Paths

### 1. Extension Integration (Standalone)

**Build a standalone browser extension** with Reclaim verification:

- Complete extension that users install from Chrome Web Store
- Users trigger verification directly from your extension popup/sidepanel
- No website required - extension works independently
- Full control over extension experience
- SDK handles all Chrome extension complexity

### 2. Web Integration (Website + Extension)

**Trigger verification from your website** using a compatible extension:

- Requires BOTH: your website + a compatible extension installed by users
- Users verify directly on your website without leaving the page
- Extension (built with this SDK) handles verification in background
- Website maintains control over UI/UX
- Users must install the extension first
