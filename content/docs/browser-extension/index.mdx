## Overview

Lightweight SDK for integrating Reclaim verification into browser extensions and websites. Handles content-background communication, provider tab management, WebAssembly proof generation, and completion events.

### Key Features

- 🔌 **Dual Integration**: Build extensions or integrate from web apps
- 🛡️ **Manifest V3 Compatible**: Full Chrome MV3 support
- ⚡ **WebAssembly Proofs**: High-performance cryptographic proof generation
- 🔄 **Event-Driven**: Real-time updates via clean event API
- 📦 **Pre-built Bundles**: No re-bundling required
- 🎯 **Auto Provider Management**: Automatic tab orchestration
- 🔐 **Network Monitoring**: Built-in request interception

## Two Integration Paths

### 1. Extension Integration (Primary)

**Build a browser extension** with Reclaim verification in popup/sidepanel:
- Users trigger verification from your extension UI
- Full control over extension experience
- SDK handles all Chrome extension complexity
- Manifest V3, offscreen documents, service workers

### 2. Web Integration (Optional)

**Trigger verification from your website** through a compatible extension:
- For websites that want to use an extension built with this SDK
- Users verify without leaving your site
- Extension handles verification, you control website UI
- Requires users to install compatible extension

## How It Works

Multi-layer architecture for secure verification:

1. **Content Script Bridge** - Communication between pages and extension
2. **Background Service Worker** - Manages offscreen docs and provider tabs
3. **Offscreen Document** - WebAssembly proof generation
4. **Network Interceptor** - Captures network requests during verification
