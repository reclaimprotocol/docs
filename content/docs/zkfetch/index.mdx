title: zkFetch SDK
description: fetch, but with a zkproof
---

This is like a regular `fetch` call, but also generates a zkProof of the request and its corresponding response.

You can think of this as a tuple `(request, response, zkproof)`.
The `zkproof` tightly couples the request and response, so it becomes impossible to fake the response - secured by cryptography.

In some cases, it might not be possible to reveal the entire request or response. That is because the request or response might contain some sensitive information like api-keys, username/passwords, PII etc.

Using zero knowledge proofs, you can redact parts of the request and response without compromising the security of the cryptographic authenticity. So, the tuple that is really generated is 
```
(redacted-request, redacted-response, zkproof)
```

You can use this library just like you would use a `fetch` call in javascript.
