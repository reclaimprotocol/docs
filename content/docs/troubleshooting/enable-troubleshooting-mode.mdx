## How to Enable Troubleshooting Mode

To help us resolve the issue you are experiencing during verification, we need a little more information from your device. Please enable Troubleshooting Mode by following the steps below.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the Login or Verification screen where the issue is occurring.
2. Locate the Address Bar at the top of the screen (where the website URL is displayed). If you ***don’t see*** the page with address bar at the top, try tapping near to the top of the screen where address bar is usually displayed. 
3. Tap on the address bar.
4. A menu will appear on your screen. Tap to select Enable Troubleshooting Mode.

Please refer to the attached video above for a visual walkthrough of this process.

## What to do next?

Once you have enabled this mode, please continue with the verification process. This will automatically collect some of the technical details we need to fix the problem.

⚠️ Sometimes failure could be because of temporary network issues, so you should please try verification again. If the problem persists, contact support with your Session ID.
