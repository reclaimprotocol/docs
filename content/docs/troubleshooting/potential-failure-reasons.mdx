## Why did it fail?

We understand it can be frustrating when things don't work as expected. If you're experiencing an issue, it might be due to one of the common reasons listed below.

### Verification Requirements Not Met ✅

For security and accuracy, some apps require a **verification requirements step**. If your information doesn't meet the required criteria, then you will not be eligible and the verification process cannot continue and will be halted. 

### Low Memory (RAM) Availability 🧠

Your device needs a certain amount of available memory, or RAM, to run processes smoothly. If other applications are using too much memory, there might not be enough for our service to function correctly, which can cause it to fail.

### Limited CPU Power 💻

The **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) is your device's brain. If it's not powerful enough or is busy with other tasks, it may struggle to keep up with the demands of the process, leading to a timeout or an error.

### Slow or Unstable Network 🌐

A stable and reasonably fast internet connection is essential. If your network is slow, drops frequently, or is unreliable, the communication with our servers can be interrupted, causing the process to fail.

### Outdated Operating System 낡

Using an **outdated operating system** (OS) can lead to compatibility issues. Our services are designed for modern systems, and older versions of Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS may lack the necessary features or security protocols to work properly.

⚠️ Sometimes failure could be because of temporary network issues, so you should please try verification again. If the problem persists, contact support with your Session ID.
