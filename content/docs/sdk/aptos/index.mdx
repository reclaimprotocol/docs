description: The Reclaim Protocol Proofs are compatible with blockchain applications and can be seamlessly integrated with Aptos blockchain.

### Overview
The Reclaim Protocol allows you to verify user data proofs on the Aptos blockchain. This integration enables decentralized verification of user-provided proofs through smart contracts.

### Integration Flow

The integration process consists of four main steps:

1. **Proof Request**
   - Implement proof requests using one of our front-end libraries:
     - [Reclaim React SDK](/js/frontend-example)
     - [Reclaim React Native SDK](/react-native)
     - [Reclaim Flutter SDK](/flutter)
   - Alternatively, use our backend solution:
     - [Reclaim Node SDK](/js/backend-example)

2. **Proof Management**
   - Once the user uploads their proof, store the proof identifier
   - Maintain necessary metadata for on-chain verification
   - Ensure secure handling of proof data

3. **Smart Contract Submission**
   - Serialize the proof data in the required format
   - Submit the serialized proof to your Aptos smart contract
   - Handle any submission errors appropriately

4. **On-chain Verification**
   - Execute proof verification within your smart contract
   - Process the verification results according to your application logic
   - Implement appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms
