import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Pre-requisite

You can access the code of this walkthrough on Gitlab:

- [Frontend example](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-wagmi-example).

This starter project illustrates the process of building a React-Reclaim client with wagmi to handle blockchain interactions.

## Code Discovery

<Steps>

## Features

- **Proof Submission**: Generate proof requests and submit them on-chain.
- **Proof Verification**: Verify submitted proofs directly through the smart contract.
- **Wallet Connection**: Built-in wallet connection.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Run this command:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-wagmi-example.git
cd reclaim-wagmi-example
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Code Configuration

We included filler data for Steam ID provider which you can use for testing. You can create your own application credentials in Reclaim's [devtool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/).

In `src/App.js`, fill in the necessary Reclaim credentials and replace `TODO` comments with your application-specific data:

```javascript
const APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID"; // Replace with your application ID
const providerId = "YOUR_PROVIDER_ID"; // Replace with your provider ID
const APP_SECRET = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"; // Replace with your app secret
```

### Set your metadata.

This React app publishes Reclaim proofs to OP Mainnet, replace address and chain id as per your use case.

```js copy showLineNumbers {6,8}
      <button
        className="button"
        onClick={async () => {
          const hash = await writeContract(config, {
            abi: abi,
            address: "0xe79A453bD088F4A58656b315a7C1f8Ea3473CCf1", //TODO : replace with your contract's address
            functionName: "verifyProof",
            chainId: 10, //TODO : replace with your chain id
            args: [proof],
          });
          if (hash) {
            setVerified(true);
          }
        }}
      >
```

### 5. Switch to another chain

If you are using another chain after replacing the **chainId** and **address** in `src/verify-proof.jsx` you need to make sure the network is added to wagmi configuration in `src/config.js` if your network doesn't exist just import it from `"wagmi/chains"` and add it to the config.

## Usage

After configuration, you can run the project locally to test the proof verification process.

### Start the Application

Run this command:

```bash
npm run start
```

1. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure your wallet is connected and set to the correct network.
2. **Request Proof**: Click the "Create Claim QR Code" button to generate a QR code for proof submission.
3. **Verify Proof**: Once the proof is received, a "Verify Proof" button appears. Click it to submit a transaction for on-chain verification.

---

### Code Overview

`src/App.js`

- Proof Request: Configures and initiates proof requests through Reclaim’s SDK.
- QR Code Generation: Displays a QR code for users to scan and submit proofs.
- Proof Submission: Handles on-chain submission upon proof verification.

`src/verify-proof.jsx`

- Proof Transformation: Transforms the received proof to be compatible with the smart contract.
- Verification Process: Sends a transaction to verify the proof on-chain and provides a link to the transaction on the explorer.
