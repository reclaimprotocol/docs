    ### Installing Python SDK

    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    pip install reclaim-python-sdk==1.0.0
    ```

    #### Verify Installation

    You can verify the installation by running:

    ```

    #### Importing the SDK

    ```python
    from reclaim_python_sdk import ReclaimProofRequest
    ```
  </Tab>

## Get an API Key
In order for you to integrate Reclaim Protocol on your backend, you will need to create an application and have the `APPLICATION_ID` and `APPLICATION_SECRET` handy for the next step. Make sure you have signed up on the [Reclaim Dev Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org) and created an application.
