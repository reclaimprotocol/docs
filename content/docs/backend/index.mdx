title: Reclaim Protocol Backend SDKs
description: This documentation helps you initiate a proof and verify the user-generated proof on the backend. This is the most secure way to request verifications.
---

## Available SDKs

Reclaim Protocol offers two backend SDKs:
- JavaScript SDK for Node.js applications
- Python SDK for Python applications

## Understanding the flow
1. Initiate a Proof Request. To initiate, you need an application ID, an application secret and a provider ID. All of which you can obtain from [the Reclaim Dev Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org).
2. Set meta data in the Proof Request.
  a. Callback Url - where the proof, once generated, is sent
  b. Context - any additional information you want to be sent back to you in the proof
3. Send the Proof Request to the frontend. See how to use ProofRequest to optimally build your UI [here](/js/fullstack-example).
4. Accept the actual proof on the callback url set above.
5. Verify the proof that has been submitted, and then continue with your business logic.
