# Quickstart

## Import module into your Swift file.

```swift
import ReclaimInAppSdk
```

## Create a request object

```swift
let request = ReclaimVerification.Request.params(
    try .init(
        appId: "APP_ID",
        secret: "APP_SECRET",
        providerId: providerId
    )
)
```
- You can get the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` using [this guide](/api-key)
- The `PROVIDER_ID` is the proof you want the user to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).


## Start the verification flow

```swift
let result = try await ReclaimVerification.startVerification(request)
```

## Verify Proofs
The returned result is a `ReclaimVerification.Response` object. This object contains a response that has proofs, exception, and the sessionId if the verification is successful.

### If successful
```swift
let proof = result.response.proofs
let sessionId = result.response.sessionId
```

### If failure
```swift
let exception = result.response.exception
```

The exception can be one of the following:
- `ReclaimVerificationError.cancelled`: The verification was cancelled by the user.
- `ReclaimVerificationError.dismissed`: The verification was dismissed by the sdk.
- `ReclaimVerificationError.failed(let error)`: The verification failed due to an error.
- `ReclaimVerificationError.sessionExpired`: The verification session expired.
