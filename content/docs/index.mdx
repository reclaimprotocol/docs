# Welcome to Reclaim Protocol
Reclaim Protocol is a cryptographic system that enables users to prove facts about their activity, reputation and identity that is available present on other apps and websites - but not easily ingestible on your own app. Think of it as a cryptographic notary for the internet - proving what's true on platforms that you don't control. Even when the said platform doesn't have APIs.

Reclaim Protocol has the best in class coverage of data sources ([2500+](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore)) and best coverage of platforms. So no matter what data point you need, no matter on what platform your app is built - you will have a first class integration experience.

## zkProofs
The artifact that is generated via Reclaim Protocol is a zkProof. This zkProof, or more generally just proof, is an encapsulation of :
1. Data that has been extracted from a webpage a user logged in into
2. The webpage the user actually logged in into
3. A cryptographic proof that both of the above are true

This proof is the centerpiece of Reclaim Protocol, and is what should give you confidence that users are not cheating the system - and proving things about themselves which is simply not true.

# Use Cases

Reclaim Protocol enables various applications, including:
- **Education Verification** - if you want to verify where and what the student is studying. Useful for marketing campaigns and background verifications.
- **Employment Verification** - If you need to make sure the user works where they claim to work. Useful for lending and hiring.
- **Financial Background** - if you need to verify financial background like credit score, accredited investor status etc. Particularly useful in lending and credit.
- **Shopping History** - if you need to give deals and discounts based on users' loyalty to certain brands
- **... and many more!**

# Real world example
Imagine you want to verify if a user is a student at a particular university to give a student discount, how would you do it?

## Traditional way
- Ask user to upload their transcripts PDF, given that most universities don't have APIs.
- Verify the transcripts either Manually or using an AI
- Give them the discount if they are a student

## Issues with the traditional way
- If you are verifying manually, well ... it will take time and resources to actually verify
- You are at the mercy of the user to upload authentic PDFs and not morphed ones

## Reclaim Protocol way
- Ask the user to login into their university student portal
- Reclaim Protocol will extract the required information that will indicate that the user is a student, after they have logged in
- Reclaim Protocol will generate a cryptographic proof that the information is accurate and has not been tampered with, solving the PDF morphing problem
