description: Install and set up the Reclaim Flutter SDK
---

The Reclaim Flutter SDK provides a seamless way to integrate Reclaim Protocol's verification system directly into your Flutter applications for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Features

- In-app verification flow with native UI
- Zero-knowledge proof generation
- Customizable themes and localization
- AI-assisted verification flows
- Compatible with "Add to App" Flutter modules
- Cross-platform support (Android 5.0+ and iOS 13.0+)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Flutter Environment**: Flutter SDK 3.35.0 or later with Dart 3.9.0 or later
2. **Reclaim Developer Account**: Login to [Reclaim Developer Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/)
3. **Application Credentials**:
   - Create an application at [Reclaim Developer Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)
   - Obtain your Application ID and Application Secret
4. **Provider ID**: Choose a data provider from [Provider Explorer](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore)

## Get an API Key

Set up your project credentials using the [Get API Key guide](/api-key).

## Installation

Add the Reclaim SDK to your Flutter project:

### Using Flutter CLI

```bash
flutter pub add reclaim_inapp_sdk
```

### Manual Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  reclaim_inapp_sdk: ^latest_version
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Android Configuration

#### Minimum Requirements

Update your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21  // Minimum Android 5.0
        targetSdkVersion 34
    }
}
```

#### Cronet for Devices Without Play Services

If you need to support Android devices without Google Play Services, add the embedded Cronet library:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Use embedded cronet for devices without play services
    implementation("org.chromium.net:cronet-embedded:119.6045.31")
}
```

### iOS Configuration

Update your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'  # Minimum iOS 13.0
```

## Environment Variables

For security best practices, store your credentials using environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
APP_ID=your_application_id_here
APP_SECRET=your_application_secret_here
PROVIDER_ID=your_provider_id_here
```

Run your app with the environment file:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=./.env
```

Access the values in your Dart code:

```dart
const String appId = String.fromEnvironment('APP_ID');
const String appSecret = String.fromEnvironment('APP_SECRET');
const String providerId = String.fromEnvironment('PROVIDER_ID');
```
