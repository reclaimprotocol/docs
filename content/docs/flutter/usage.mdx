description: Flutter SDK for Reclaim Protocol
---

# Quickstart
## Import the SDK in your Dart file

```dart
import 'package:reclaim_inapp_flutter_sdk/reclaim_inapp_flutter_sdk.dart';
```

## Initialize the SDK with your app credentials
```dart
const String appId = String.fromEnvironment('APP_ID');
const String appSecret = String.fromEnvironment('APP_SECRET');
const String providerId = String.fromEnvironment('PROVIDER_ID');
```
- You can get the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` using [this guide](/api-key)
- The `PROVIDER_ID` is the proof you want the user to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).


## Starting Verification

```dart
final sdk = ReclaimInAppSdk.of(context);
final proofs = await sdk.startVerification(
  ReclaimVerificationRequest(
    appId: appId,
    providerId: providerId,
    secret: appSecret,
    sessionInformation: ReclaimSessionInformation.empty(),
    contextString: '',
    parameters: {},
    claimCreationType: ClaimCreationType.standalone,
  ),
);
```

## Verifying proofs
You don't need to separately verify the proofs as you would [in the js-sdk](/js-sdk/verifying-proofs). If the verification failed, you will get an exception. If there is no exception, the proof was generated correctly _and_ verified correctly.



# Advanced Options
## Pre-warming

For better performance, you can pre-warm the SDK:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  ReclaimInAppSdk.preWarm();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
