# Quickstart

## Import

```kotlin
import org.reclaimprotocol.inapp_sdk.ReclaimVerification
```

## Create a request object

Using credentials from AndroidManifest.xml:
```kotlin
val request = ReclaimVerification.Request(
    appId = "YOUR_APP_ID",
    secret = "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
    providerId = "YOUR_PROVIDER_ID"
)
```

- You can get the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` using [this guide](/api-key).
- The `PROVIDER_ID` is the proof you want the user to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).


## Start the verification flow


```kotlin
ReclaimVerification.startVerification(
    context = context,
    request = request,
    handler = object : ReclaimVerification.ResultHandler {
        override fun onException(exception: ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException) {
            // Proof generation or verification failed
        }

        override fun onResponse(response: ReclaimVerification.Response) {
            // Proof generated and verified successfully
        }
    }
)
```

The returned result `ReclaimVerification.ResultHandler.onResponse` in is a `ReclaimVerification.Response` object. This object contains a response that has proofs, exception, and the sessionId if the verification is successful.

If the verification is cancelled or failed, the handler's `ReclaimVerification.ResultHandler.onException` method is called with a `ReclaimVerification.ReclaimVerificationException` object.
