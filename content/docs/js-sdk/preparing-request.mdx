title: Preparing the proof request
description: Create a request for a proof generation on the backend
---

# What is a proof request?
You need to prepare a proof request that will then be presented to the user on the frontend. 
This proof request, most importantly, tells the user 
1. With which application they will be sharing the data with
2. What is it that they need to prove to the said application

# Quickstart
This is the simplest version of creating a proof request. 

## Import the library
```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
```

## Create an endpoint to build the `Proof Request` on your backend
```javascript
const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(
    'APP_ID',
    'APP_SECRET',
    'PROVIDER_ID'
)
```
- You can get the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` using [this guide](/api-key)
- The `PROVIDER_ID` is the proof you want the user to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).

## Send back the proof request object to the frontend
```javascript
const proofRequestObject = reclaimProofRequest.toJsonString();
```

## Sample implementation in Next.js
```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
 
export async function GET(request) {
  let providerId = 'example';

  // add logic to choose provider id here based on request

  // Initialize SDK with server-side environment variables (secure)
  const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(
      process.env.RECLAIM_APP_ID,
      process.env.RECLAIM_APP_SECRET,
      providerId,
  );

  // Convert to JSON string (safe for frontend)
  const proofRequestObject = reclaimProofRequest.toJsonString();

  return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      proofRequest: proofRequestObject
  });
}
```

proofRequestOptions = {
    ..., //other options, if any
    useAppClip: false,
    customSharePageUrl: 'CONTACT_SUPPORT_FOR_URL'
}

const proofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(appId, appSecret, providerId, proofRequestOptions);
```

## Set Context
You can set context to the proof request that helps identify the request when you receive it back in the callback.
```
reclaimProofRequest.setContext('address', 'message')
```
- `address` : this is usually a unique identifier for the user. This could be an email address, a wallet address, or just a session id
- `message` : this is an open field where you can add any other information that you want passed around from the build request to the callback endpoint. You can stringify jsons here for convenience. 

## Set Callback 
```
reclaimProofRequest.setAppCallbackUrl(url)
```
Set a backend callback URL where Reclaim Protocol will POST proofs directly after verification. This enables secure backend proof processing without relying on frontend to upload the proof.
