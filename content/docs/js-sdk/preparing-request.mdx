title: Preparing the proof request
description: Create a request for a proof generation on the backend

# What is a proof request?
You need to prepare a proof request that will then be presented to the user on the frontend. 
This proof request, most importantly, tells the user 
1. With which application they will be sharing the proof
2. What is it that they need to prove to the said application

# Quickstart
This is the simplest version of creating a proof request. For more advanced options, see the next section - More Options.

## Import the library
```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
```

## Create an endpoint to build the `Proof Request`
```javascript
const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(
    'APP_ID',
    'APP_SECRET',
    'PROVIDER_ID'
)
```
- You can get the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` using [this guide](/api-key)
- The `PROVIDER_ID` is the proof you want the user to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).

## Set a callback url
The callback url is important. Once the proof is generated, this will be the endpoint to which the proof will be uploaded after the proof is generated by the user. This would be where you will update the state of the user to verified - once the proof is uploaded and verified. We will look at the implementation in the [verify the proof](/js-sdk/verify-proof) section.

You will need to set the `callbackUrl` when building the proof request.
```javascript
reclaimProofRequest.setAppCallbackUrl('https://yourdomain.com/api/reclaimprotocol-callback')
```
## Send back the proof request object to the frontend
```javascript
const proofRequestObject = reclaimProofRequest.toJsonString();
```

## Sample implementation in Next.js
```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
 
export async function GET(request) {
  let providerId = 'example';

  // add logic to choose provider id here based on request

  // Initialize SDK with server-side environment variables (secure)
  const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(
      process.env.RECLAIM_APP_ID,
      process.env.RECLAIM_APP_SECRET,
      providerId,
  );

  const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL;
  reclaimProofRequest.setAppCallbackUrl(`${baseUrl}/api/reclaimprotocol-callback`);

  // Convert to JSON string (safe for frontend)
  const proofRequestObject = reclaimProofRequest.toJsonString();

  return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      proofRequest: proofRequestObject
  });
}
```


# More Options
## Set Context
You can set context to the proof request that helps identify the request when you receive it back in the callback.
```
reclaimProofRequest.setContext('address', 'message')
```
- `address` : this is usually a unique identifier for the user. This could be an email address, a wallet address, or just a session id
- `message` : this is an open field where you can add any other information that you want passed around from the build request to the callback endpoint. You can stringify jsons here for convenience.
