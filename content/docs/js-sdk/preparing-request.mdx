title: Preparing the proof request
description: Create a request for a proof generation on the backend
---

# Quickstart
This is the simplest version of creating a proof request. 

## Import the library
```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
```

## Setup a request on the backend
```javascript
const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(
    'APP_ID',
    'APP_SECRET',
    'PROVIDER_ID'
)
```
- You can get the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` using [this guide](/api-key)
- The `PROVIDER_ID` is the proof you want the user to generate. You can see all the [available providers here](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/explore).

## Send back the proof request object to the frontend
```javascript
const proofRequestObject = reclaimProofRequest.toJsonString();
```

## Sample implementation in Next.js
```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
 
export async function GET(request) {
  let providerId = 'example';

  // add logic to choose provider id here based on request

  proofRequestOptions = {
    ..., //other options, if any
    useAppClip: false,
    customSharePageUrl: 'https://portal.reclaimprotocol.org'
  }

  // Initialize SDK with server-side environment variables (secure)
  // and request options
  const reclaimProofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(      
      process.env.RECLAIM_APP_ID,
      process.env.RECLAIM_APP_SECRET,
      providerId,
      proofRequestOptions);

  // Convert to JSON string (safe for frontend)
  const proofRequestObject = reclaimProofRequest.toJsonString();

  return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      proofRequest: proofRequestObject
  });
}
```


# Advance Options
We recommend most, if not all of the following to be set for most production usecases :

## Set Context

### Set Address & Message as context

You can set context to the proof request that helps identify the request when you receive it back in the callback once the proof is generated.

```js
reclaimProofRequest.setContext('address', 'message')
```

- `address` : this is usually a unique identifier for the user. This could be an email address, a wallet address, or just a session id generated on your system
- `message` : this is an open field where you can add any other information that you want passed around from the build request to the callback endpoint. You can stringify jsons here for convenience. 

### Set JSON Context

A JSON serializable object can also be set as context. For doing this, use `setJsonContext` method.

```js
reclaimProofRequest.setJsonContext({
  address: 'hello@example.org',
  sessionId: '123'
})
```

> [!WARNING]
> Both [setContext](/js-sdk/preparing-request#set-address--message-as-context) and [setJsonContext](/js-sdk/preparing-request#set-json-context) overwrite each other. Each call replaces the existing context.

## Set Callback URLs

### Success Callback

```js
reclaimProofRequest.setAppCallbackUrl(url, jsonProofResponse)
```

Set a backend callback URL where Reclaim Protocol will send proofs directly after verification. In this case proofs are sent only to the custom URL *instead* of the Reclaim backend. This enables secure backend proof processing without relying on your frontend to upload the proof.

By default, proofs are sent as HTTP `POST` with `Content-Type` as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Pass function argument `jsonProofResponse` as `true` to send proofs with `Content-Type` as `application/json`. 

You can see the data structure of the proofs you will receive [here](/troubleshooting/anatomy#proof).

> [!Note]
> If you are using `reclaimProofRequest.startSession` after setting a custom success callback URL, then the proofs will be sent to the custom URL *instead* of the Reclaim backend. Because of this, the startSession `onSuccess` callback will be invoked with an empty array (`[]`) instead of the proof data, as the proof is not available to the SDK in this flow.

### Cancel Callback

The easiest way to handle cancellations by user is to set up a cancel callback. This allows your application to react immediately when a user's verification session terminates.

```js
reclaimProofRequest.setCancelCallbackUrl("https://yourwebsite.com/reclaim-cancelcallback"); // POST request webpage 
```

If the user cancels the session midway or after error, Reclaim will send a POST request to you on the cancel callback URL with details. The body will contain:

```json
{
  "type": "string", // Name of the exception are in the table below
  "message": "string",
  [key: any]: any
}
```

#### What triggers cancel callback?

Following are some exceptions that happen when user presses a button to cancel in UI or provider custom injection script causes a cancellation by calling `Reclaim.reportProviderError` in browser.

| Exception Name (`type` field) | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `ReclaimVerificationAbortedException` | User cancelled the verification (e.g., tapped on cancel or verify another way button). |
| `ReclaimVerificationProviderScriptException` | The provider script encountered an error (e.g., login failed, invalid account used). |

Other errors (such as network timeouts or internal exceptions) may also trigger this callback if **auto submit is enabled**. In any case, you can always find the complete list of errors by [fetching analytics events](../troubleshooting/analytics-event) for the session.

## Redirect after proof generation or cancellation

### Success Redirect URL

If you want to redirect the user after generating the proof to a specific webpage or app, you can do so using `setRedirectUrl`. 

When you should use this:

- User is on a desktop, scans QR code to generate the proof. After the proof generation is complete you want to show a custom success message on their mobile device instead of the Reclaim Protocol's default success message. You can redirect them to a webpage.
- User is on a mobile, taps a button to generate the proof. After the proof generation is complete, you typically want to redirect the user to the page that must be shown after the proof generation is complete. If you are using `onSuccess`, the user will have to close the proof generation success banner and go back to the browser to continue. We recommend using a redirect url to take the user to the next step in the business logic. On this step, render a page depending on whether the proof was correctly verified.

```javascript
// Redirect to success page after verification
reclaimProofRequest.setRedirectUrl("https://yourapp.com/verification/success");
 
// Or deep link back to a mobile app
reclaimProofRequest.setRedirectUrl("yourapp://verification-complete");
```

Redirection happens after success callback is invoked by reclaim.

### Cancel Redirect Url

Set a custom URL to redirect users when their verification process is cancelled. This allows your application to react immediately when a user's verification session terminates.

```javascript
reclaimProofRequest.setCancelRedirectUrl("https://example.com/cancel-redirect");
```

Redirection happens after cancel callback is invoked by reclaim. See [What triggers a Cancel Callback](/js-sdk/preparing-request#what-triggers-cancel-callback) for more details.

## Set Parameters
If you already know what the value of the extracted parameter is supposed to be, you can set that using `setParams`.
For example, if you know that the user's name before hand - and you want them to prove something from a website and you need the name to match exactly, you should use set the name in the params. Be sure to use the same key as the parameter name on the Provider you are using.

If the extracted parameter doesn't match the set parameter, the proof generation will fail.
```javascript
reclaimProofRequest.setParams({ 
    name : "John Doe"
})
```


## Add additional metadata for verification client

Additional metadata to pass to the verification client. This can be used to customize the client experience, such as customizing themes or UI by passing context-specific information. 
The keys and values must be strings. For most clients, this is not required and goes unused.

```js
// Initialize with options
const proofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(APP_ID, APP_SECRET, PROVIDER_ID, {
  metadata: { theme: 'dark' },
});
```

## Set preferred locale for verification client

You can change the language for the UI seen by User during verification by setting the `preferredLocale` parameter in the initialization options.

This is used to select a user's language and formatting preferences in the verification journey.

The value of this field must be a Unicode Language Identifier (i.e. without Locale extensions), except variants are not supported.
Locale values are expected to be canonicalized according to the "preferred value" entries in the [IANA Language Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). 
For example, `he`, and `iw` are equal and both have the languageCode `he`, because `iw` is a deprecated language subtag that was replaced by the subtag `he`.

Defaults to the browser's locale if available, otherwise English (en).

```js
// Initialize with options
const proofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(APP_ID, APP_SECRET, PROVIDER_ID, {
  preferredLocale: 'en-US',
});
```

## Using the in-browser SDK
<Callout type="warning">
  In-Browser SDK use is available only for users on a premium enterprise plan. Please [contact support](https://t.me/protocolreclaim) for more details.
</Callout>

If you don't want to use the in-browser SDK, the users will be asked to install the Reclaim Protocol App/Appclip. You can disable by removing this configuration from the above snipped :
```js
//REMOVE :
proofRequestOptions = {
    ..., //other options, if any
    useAppClip: false,
    customSharePageUrl: 'https://portal.reclaimprotocol.org'
}
const proofRequest = await ReclaimProofRequest.init(appId, appSecret, providerId, proofRequestOptions);
```
