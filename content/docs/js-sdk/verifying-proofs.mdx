title: Verifying the proof
description: Critical step to make sure user is not trying to defraud your app

# Why do I need to verify, when the proof has already been generated?
The [proof generation](/js-sdk/generating-proof) is a client side operation. On Success Callback is only responsible for notifying when the proof is generated successfully. All the proofs generated should be verified on your backend as a malicious user can bypass any check you add on the frontend.

Verifying proofs is a very simple light weight operation. You can think of it as verifying the digital signatures to make sure the data is tamper resistant.

# Quickstart
## Setup the callback endpoint
This should be the endpoint that will be called by your [`onSuccess` callback](generating-proof).

This endpoint should be of type `POST`.

## Decode the proof object
```javascript
const proofs = JSON.parse(decodedBody);
```

## Verify the proof
```javascript
import { verifyProof } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';

...
  const isValid = await verifyProof(proofs[i]); // loop over proofs if multiple
```

## Extract the data
### Context
If you set contextAddress and contextMessage when building the request, you can get them back :
```javascript
const {contextAddress, contextMessage} = JSON.parse(proofs[i].context);
```
### Extacted Parameters
The data that was extracted from the webpage that the user logged in into, depending on what data was configured to be extracted using the provider you had set when building the request.
```
const { extractedParameters } = JSON.parse(proofs[i].context);
```
