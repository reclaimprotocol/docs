title: Verifying the proof
description: Critical step to make sure user is not trying to defraud your app

# Why do I need to verify, when the proof has already been generated?
The [proof generation](/js-sdk/generating-proof) is a client side operation to protect the privacy and security of the user. Once the proof is generate, the proof is uploaded to the backend. A malicious user may generate a proof (or not) on their client side - and choose to upload an arbitrary json object to your backend. If you don't verify the proof, the arbitrary JSON object and the actual Prooj JSON object will be indistinguishable.

Verifying proofs is a very simple light weight operation. You can think of it as verifying the digital signatures to make sure the data is tamper proof.

# Quickstart
## Setup the callback endpoint
This should be the same callback endpoint that was set when [building the proof request](preparing-request).

This endpoint should be of type `POST`.

## Decode the proof object
The proof object is a URIEncoded JSON object. So, you need to decode it and then parse it.
```javascript
const decodedBody = decodeURIComponent(req.body);
const proofs = JSON.parse(decodedBody);
```

## Verify the proof
```javascript
import { verifyProof } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';

...
const isValid = await verifyProof(proofs);
```

## Extract the data
### Context
If you set contextAddress and contextMessage when building the request, you can get them back :
```javascript
const {contextAddress, contextMessage} = JSON.parse(proofs[i].context);
```
### Extacted Parameters
The data that was extracted from the webpage that the user logged in into, depending on what data was configured to be extracted using the provider you had set when building the request.
```
const { extractedParameters } = JSON.parse(proofs[i].context);
```

## Sanity Check

# Structure of proofs
