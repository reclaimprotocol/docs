---

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

## Get API Credentials

Before using the SDK, you will need to [obtain your credentials](/api-key) from the [DevTool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org):


## Installation

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
```bash tab="npm"
npm install @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```
</Tabs>

# Next steps
There are 3 steps in integrating the JavaScript SDK
1. [Preparing](preparing-request) the proof request on the backend
2. Asking the user to [generate](generating-proof) the proof on the frontend
3. Uploading the proof to the backend and [verifying](verifying-proof) it

This guide will walk you through each of these three steps.
