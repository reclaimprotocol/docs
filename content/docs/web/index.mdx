## Understanding the WebSDKs workflow

### Steps involved
1. A verification session is created on the frontend and displayed to the user to tap/scan QR code.
2. The user starts the session and completes the verification using the Reclaim Protocol [AppClip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/)/[InstantApp](https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant). The verification must be done using a mobile phone. No app install is required.
3. Once the user completes the verification, they will be prompted to redirect back to your webapp.
4. The webapp polls the status of the verification session and continues business logic, once the verification has been marked as complete.
5. The backend will verify the proof and return the result to the frontend.

### What you need to implement
1. [Frontend](./web/frontend) application using React
2. [Backend](./web/backend) application to process the verification securely using NodeJS/Python
