**⚠️ Documentation Deprecated**

These Web SDK docs are being deprecated in favor of the new, improved documentation structure.

Please use the new documentation:
- **[JavaScript SDK →](/js-sdk)** - For JavaScript/TypeScript web applications (recommended)
- **Backend verification examples** - Now includes both Node.js and Python

The new docs feature:
- Better organization and structure
- More framework examples (React, Next.js, Vue, Vanilla JS)
- Clearer security guidance
- Production-ready patterns
- Comprehensive API reference

Existing code using these docs will continue to work, but we recommend migrating to the new structure for better documentation and examples.

## Understanding the WebSDKs workflow

### Steps involved
1. A verification session is created on the frontend and displayed to the user to tap/scan QR code.
2. The user starts the session and completes the verification using the Reclaim Protocol [AppClip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/)/[InstantApp](https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant). The verification must be done using a mobile phone. No app install is required.
3. Once the user completes the verification, they will be prompted to redirect back to your webapp.
4. The webapp polls the status of the verification session and continues business logic, once the verification has been marked as complete.
5. The backend will verify the proof and return the result to the frontend.

### What you need to implement
1. [Frontend](./web/frontend) application using React
2. [Backend](./web/backend) application to process the verification securely using NodeJS/Python
