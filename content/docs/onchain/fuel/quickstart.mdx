import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Pre-requisite

You can access the code on Github, it is a monorepo holding both contract and frontend code:

- [Fuel SDK](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/fuel-sdk-onchain-integration).

You need to have `forc` and Fuel wallet (or another) installed to continue this guide. Fuel docs provide a comprehensive [quickstart](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/user-quickstart/).  

## Contract 

You can skip this part if you wish to verify on our [deployed contract](https://app-testnet.fuel.network/contract/0x236d2b425f64c7424fa44f5d6eb555e411b618653b160bb9bc4525f18d029b06/transactions) with address `0x236d2b425f64c7424fa44f5d6eb555e411b618653b160bb9bc4525f18d029b06`.

<Steps>
### Clone the client contract repo.

```bash copy
git https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/fuel-sdk-onchain-integration
cd fuel-sdk-onchain-integration
forc build
```

### Deploy the contract.

Deploy to Fuel network and instantiate the contract.

```bash copy
forc deploy --testnet
```

Save the contract address, it is the only contract-specific metadata to be used in the frontend client.


</Steps>


## Client development
<Steps>

### Cloning the frontend repo.

Change directory to `/frontend`:

```bash
cd frontend
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Submitting the proof.

```bash
npm run dev
```
After requesting a proof from Reclaim and performing the verification on your end, a verify proof button will appear on the screen.
Make sure your wallet is connected, click the button, a wallet pop-up will show prompting you to submit.
