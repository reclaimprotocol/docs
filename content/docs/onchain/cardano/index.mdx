### Overview
Reclaim Protocol Proofs provide a secure way to verify user data in blockchain applications. This guide explains the implementation flow from requesting proofs to on-chain verification.

### Implementation Flow

1. **Request Proofs**
   - Implement proof requests using one of our official SDKs:
     - [React SDK](/web/frontend) for web applications
     - [React Native SDK](/react-native/installation) for mobile applications
     - [Flutter SDK](/flutter/installation) for cross-platform applications
     - [Node.js SDK](/web/backend/installation) for backend implementations

2. **Handle Proof Upload**
   - Once the user uploads the proof, store the proof identifier or reference
   - This reference will be needed for subsequent verification steps

3. **Submit Proof to Smart Contract**
   - Convert the proof into a blockchain-compatible format (serialization)
   - Submit the serialized proof to your designated smart contract

4. **Verify On-chain**
   - The smart contract performs verification of the submitted proof
   - Implement appropriate logic to handle verification results

### Next Steps
- Review our [Smart Contract Integration Guide] for detailed verification implementation
- Explore [Example Implementations] for practical usage scenarios
- Check our [Security Best Practices] for proof handling
