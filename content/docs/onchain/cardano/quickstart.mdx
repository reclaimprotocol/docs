import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Working knowledge of ReactJS development ([Frontend Development Guide](/web/frontend))
- A Cardano-compatible wallet (e.g., Nami) configured for testnet
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Access to the [example codebase](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/pluts-sdk)

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to integrate Reclaim Protocol's zero-knowledge proofs with decentralized identity (DID) on the Cardano blockchain using Atala PRISM/Hyperledger Identus. The integration process involves:

1. Generating a Reclaim Protocol proof
2. Creating a Decentralized Identifier (DID)
3. Issuing a Verifiable Credential (VC) linked to the proof
4. Securing the proof and credentials on-chain
5. Implementing on-chain verification for secure access

This integration creates a robust identity verification system combining zero-knowledge proofs with self-sovereign identity on Cardano.

## Implementation Guide

<Steps>

### 1. Project Setup

Initialize the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/pluts-sdk

cd pluts-sdk

npm install
```

### 2. Understanding Lock Transactions (`lockTx.ts`)

**Core Components:**

- **Proof Management**: Handles Reclaim Protocol proof retrieval
- **Identity Creation**: Manages DID and VC generation through Atala PRISM/Identus
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles on-chain data storage

**Key Functions:**
- `getLockTx`: Constructs transaction with proof and identity data
- `lockTx`: Handles transaction signing and submission

### 3. Understanding Unlock Transactions (`unlockTx.ts`)

**Core Components:**

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches on-chain DID and VC information
- **Verification Logic**: Validates credentials and ownership
- **Transaction Processing**: Manages asset release

**Key Functions:**
- `getUnlockTx`: Prepares unlock transaction with verification checks
- `unlockTx`: Processes final transaction submission

### 4. Smart Contract Logic (`reclaimPlutus.ts`)

**Contract Components:**

- **Validation Logic**: Defines rules for proof and credential verification
- **Data Structures**: 
  - Datum: Stores proof and credential data
  - Redeemer: Contains unlock conditions
- **Network Configuration**: Includes testnet address settings

### 5. Implementation Process

**Wallet Configuration**
- Connect your Cardano wallet (e.g., Nami)
- Ensure testnet configuration

**Proof Generation and Identity Creation**
1. Generate Reclaim Protocol proof via QR code or app
2. Create DID using proof data
3. Issue VC linking proof to identity

**Locking Process**
1. Prepare transaction with proof, DID, and VC
2. Submit lock transaction to chain

**Unlocking Process**
1. Retrieve on-chain credentials
2. Verify VC authenticity
3. Process unlock transaction

## Deployment Information

The smart contract is live on Cardano testnet. View the contract at [Cardanoscan](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/address/addr_test1wzv5v4jx3xaz4nlgp6j6juw707huauprhfdkst66mlh0fcsgk7uvw).

## Summary

This implementation provides:
- Secure proof generation and identity creation
- On-chain credential storage and verification
- Controlled asset access through verified credentials
- Integration of zero-knowledge proofs with decentralized identity

The system ensures that only verified entities can access locked assets while maintaining privacy and security through zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials.
