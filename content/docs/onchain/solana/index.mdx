### Flow

1. Your app requests proofs from the user using one of the front-end libraries like [Reclaim React SDK](/web/frontend), [Reclaim React Native SDK](/react-native/installation), [Reclaim Flutter SDK](/flutter/installation) or a backend library like [Reclaim Node SDK](/web/backend/installation)
2. Once the user has uploaded the proof, you can serialize it into a Solana friendly format
3. Submit the serialized proof to your smart contract
4. Verify the proof on the smart contract
5. Use the signer address in further business logic
