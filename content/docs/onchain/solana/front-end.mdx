import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Pre-requisite

You can access the code of this walkthrough on Github:

- [Frontend example](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-solana-example).

This starter project illustrates the process of building a Solana-Reclaim client application in Next.js.


## Code Discovery

<Steps>
### Clone the starter repo.

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-solana-example.git
cd reclaim-solana-example
npm i 
npm run dev
```

### Set your metadata.

The starter repo has already-filled configurations for addresses, IDL, and Reclaim credintials. Add your own metadata as per your use case.
```js copy 

const EPOCH_CONFIG_ADDRESS = new PublicKey("FUmVofehkRN6RG4CT8eeszswuqtDcZbCgVKMCQFLvgfY");

const RECLAIM_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey("8rYXFrtST4ePpMWcEqhazFyRG2DtCUqgtFmKT7FdjRyp");

const SEED_PREFIX = new TextEncoder().encode("reclaim");
const SEED_EPOCH = new TextEncoder().encode("epoch");

```

Also, note that we are using Devnet and Solflare wallet for this example.
### Publish proof.


As in [JS SDK](/js-sdk/installation), our starter app shows a QR-code for you to scan and create proof. Upon successfull proof generation, A button with the text `Verify Proof` appears. Clicking this button prompts you to publish the obtained proof.
