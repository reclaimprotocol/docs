import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Overview
This guide walks you through deploying a Reclaim contract on Aleph Zero and building a frontend interface to interact with it. You'll learn how to generate and verify proofs using the Reclaim protocol.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Completed the setup steps from the [ReactJs guide](/js/frontend-example)
- Installed the [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) wallet
- Funded your wallet with test tokens
- Basic familiarity with React and smart contracts

Reference implementations are available on GitLab:
- [Smart Contract Repository](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/ink-sdk.git)
- [Frontend Repository](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-example)

## Contract Deployment

> **Note**: If you don't need custom contract logic, you can skip this section and use our [pre-deployed testnet contract](https://ui.use.ink/contract/5FB2yCSyjJbKjMJXP8dgZ1kWa7Rin2x9afxzUbmRAaWEj43P).

<Steps>
### Deploy the Reclaim Contract

Clone and build the contract:
```bash copy
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/ink-sdk.git
cd reclaim-aleph-client
cargo contract build --release
```

This contract:
- Acts as a client for the Reclaim protocol
- Manages proof instantiation and verification
- Supports custom validation logic (optional)

### Deploy to Network

1. Visit the [Contract UI](https://ui.use.ink/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Upload the generated `.contract` file
4. Deploy using your account

### Initialize Epoch

Configure the contract's epoch through the Contract UI:

Required parameters:
- `minimum_witness_for_claim_creation`: Set to 1
- `witnesses`: Use the following array:
```json
[{
    "address": "0x244897572368eadf65bfbc5aec98d8e5443a9072",
    "host": "reclaim.testnet"
}]
```

</Steps>

## Frontend Implementation

<Steps>

### Setup Frontend Environment

Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/starterpacks/reclaim-aleph-example
cd reclaim-aleph-example
npm install
```

### Configure Components

#### GenerateProofPage.tsx
This component handles proof generation and storage:
- Implements the `onSuccessCallback` to save proofs
- Requires your Reclaim credentials (look for `//TODO` comments)
- Enables navigation to the proof verification page

#### Contract Configuration
If using a custom contract deployment:

1. Update `src/metadata/addresses.json`:
   - Add your contract's address

2. Update `src/metadata/reclaim.json`:
   - Include your contract's ABI

#### Proof Verification (src/utils/verifyProof.ts)
Customize this file if you:
- Modified the `verify_proof` function
- Added custom verification logic
- Need to call different contract functions

### Launch and Test

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

Workflow:
1. Connect your wallet to the application
2. Generate a proof using the Reclaim interface
3. Navigate to the "Verify Proof" page
4. Submit the proof for on-chain verification

</Steps>

## Next Steps
- Explore adding custom verification logic to the contract
- Implement additional frontend features
- Test with different proof types
- Review the [Reclaim Protocol documentation](https://docs.reclaimprotocol.org/) for advanced features
