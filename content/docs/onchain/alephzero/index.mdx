description: The Reclaim Protocol Proofs enable secure data verification in blockchain applications.
---

### Overview
The Alephzero SDK allows you to integrate and verify Reclaim Protocol Proofs in your blockchain applications. These proofs provide a secure way to validate user data while maintaining privacy and authenticity.

### Implementation Flow

1. **Request Proofs**
   - Implement proof requests in your application using one of our official SDKs:
     - [Reclaim React SDK](/js/frontend-example) for web applications
     - [Reclaim React Native SDK](/react-native) for mobile applications
     - [Reclaim Flutter SDK](/flutter) for cross-platform applications
     - [Reclaim Node SDK](/js/backend-example) for backend implementations

2. **Handle Proof Upload**
   - Once the user successfully uploads their proof, store the proof identifier
   - Maintain proper record-keeping for subsequent verification

3. **Submit for Verification**
   - Transform the proof into its serialized format
   - Submit the serialized proof to your designated smart contract

4. **Verify On-Chain**
   - Execute the verification process within your smart contract
   - Handle the verification result according to your application logic
