### Implementation Flow

1. **Request Proofs**
   - Implement proof requests in your application using one of our official SDKs:
     - [Reclaim JS SDK](/js-sdk/installation) for web and backend implementations
     - [Reclaim React Native SDK](/react-native/installation) for mobile applications
     - [Reclaim Flutter SDK](/flutter/installation) for cross-platform applications

2. **Handle Proof Upload**
   - Once the user successfully uploads their proof, store the proof identifier
   - Maintain proper record-keeping for subsequent verification

3. **Submit for Verification**
   - Transform the proof into its serialized format
   - Submit the serialized proof to your designated smart contract

4. **Verify On-Chain**
   - Execute the verification process within your smart contract
   - Handle the verification result according to your application logic

### Next Steps
After understanding the basic flow, refer to our specific SDK documentation for detailed implementation guidelines and best practices.
