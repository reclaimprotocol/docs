## Overview
This guide walks you through deploying and interacting with the Reclaim Protocol on the Aptos blockchain. You'll learn how to set up the environment, deploy smart contracts, and build a frontend interface.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Completed the setup steps from the [JS guide](/js-sdk/installation)
- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/) installed (recommended)

### Wallet Configuration

1. **Install Petra Wallet**
   - Download and install from [petra.app](https://petra.app/)
   - Follow the wallet setup instructions

2. **Configure Network Settings**
   - Open Petra Wallet
   - Click the settings icon (bottom right)
   - Navigate to "Networks"
   - Select "Testnet"

3. **Get Test Tokens**
   - Visit the [Aptos Faucet](https://www.aptosfaucet.com/)
   - Request testnet APT tokens for testing

### Source Code Access

Access the required repositories:
- Smart Contract: [Reclaim Contract Repository](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/aptos-sdk-onchain-integration)
- Frontend Demo: [Frontend Example](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-aptos-example)

## Contract Deployment

> **Note**: If you don't need custom contract logic, you can use our [pre-deployed testnet contract](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/object/0xd33b912ac96983caa70ac9f44f7e274d1a29158c71e40c26b967e75e72a11d5f/transactions?network=testnet).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Compilation Errors**: Add `--skip-fetch-latest-git-deps` flag if encountering Git state errors
2. **Network Issues**: Ensure you're connected to Aptos testnet
3. **Transaction Failures**: Verify wallet has sufficient APT balance
